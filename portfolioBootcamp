Andrea Wensley 
I began programming about 3 years ago in my high school in California. I first started by learning python and performing introductory labs. After realizing my interests surrounding computer science I enrolled in a more in depth python class at UC Berkeley where I significantly enhanced my understanding. Most recently, in my final year of high school I learned the basics of Java.

I concluded the 2 week coding bootcamp by creating a project that contains an Andy Warhol image surrounded by inspired pop art graphics. In addition to learning how to navigate uploading an image on to processing, I also experimented with different fonts. My code utilizes several loops and the random feature in order to create a more dynamic display of shapes. Lastly I incorporated what we recently learned about 3D objects to create shifting spheres.
